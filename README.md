#Point to Point Motion Control for Nonholonomic Differential Drive Robot
This was made as an assignment for Mechatronic and Robotic Class in Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB)

The aim is for the robot to prioritize position over orientation as to make use of differential drive robot ability to rotate in place. This algorithm also allows the robot to move in reverse when the target position is located behind the robot.
